  <h1 class="heading">What does ElevenTail give me?</h1>
  <p>
    ElevenTail is the starting point <a href="https://twitter.com/philhawksworth">that I use</a> when building a site where I want to have:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://11ty.dev">Eleventy</a> for site generation configured with some common conventions like <a href="/blog">blog</a> collection</li>
    <li><a href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind CSS</a> for a utility-based CSS pipeline</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.purgecss.com/">Purge CSS</a> for stripping unused CSS and minifying the result</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/uglify-js">Uglify JS</a> for basic JavaScript build pipeline</li>
    <li>Serverless functions development pipeline via <a href="https://netlify.com/products/functions">Netlify Functions</a></li>
    <li>Local support of <a href="https://netlify.com/products/edge">Netlify CDN</a> abilities such as <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/routing/redirects/redirect-options/">redirects</a> and <a href="https://docs.netlify.com/routing/headers">custom headers</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    ElevenTail is not a product, it's just something I maintain to use for myself. If you think it might be useful to you too, then great! Suggestions and contributions as pull requests are also welcome.
